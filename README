Simple mail merging

mailmerge.pl template data [subject]

Takes a template file and a data file containing a list
of recipients, one per line. The fields are tab separated

user1@host	field1	field2	field3	...
user2@host	field1	field2	field3	...

The template file can use '$1', '$2', ... which will be replaced
with the data in field1, fiel2, ...

e.g.
------------------
Dear $1,

Welcome to York! To log in, your account is:

Username: $2
Password: $3

Regards

Admin
-------------------

The subject argument is optional, but can also use $1,$2 etc. 
The difference is that these need to be escaped e.g.

mailmerge.pl template data "account for \$1"

note the extra '\'.
